# About the project

Hello world! This is my first entry to the [Introduction to Open Data Science 2020](https://mooc.helsinki.fi/course/view.php?id=385) course project. This course teaches data analysis using R and writing stuff down with R Markdown. Interesting and useful stuff. Previously I've worked with Python and GitHub-flavored Markdown syntax.

I hope to learn more of the "statistics" side in data science. Topics such as

- How to ensure my analysis is statistically sound?
- How to process the data "properly" (outlier detection etc)?
- How to select proper methods and descriptive "output numbers"?
- How to discern independent and co-dependent parameters from the data.

By the way, here is the link to my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pkars/IODS-project) for this project. Currently it's rather empty as the "real" work starts next week...
