# Analysis of longitudinal data
Hoo boy. It's the last week of IODS course, and this time we're analyzing data
that includes non-independent measurements (e.g. repeated measurements of
a test subject over time). Let's start with the libraries and data exploration!
```{r ch6-setup}
```

This week's assignment has a twist! We are going to do the exercises from 
Vehkalahti and Everitt (2019) book *Multivariate Analysis for The Behavioral Sciences*, 
chapters 8 and 9, except with the data sets swapped between the chapters. So first
we have the `rats` data introduced in Ch. 9: ***[[TODO]]***

```{r c6-data}
```

Next, we have the `bprs`data introduced in Ch. 8: ***[[TODO]]***
